// Part 1
// Design your Data Model
//! 1. Create an appropriate schema for a blog.
//? - What collections do you need?
//* I will create 2 collections
//* one for users and one for posts.
//? - How are you going to structure your documents?
//* each user document will include
//* {_id: user._id, name: user.name, email: user.email, posts: [post1id, post2id...]}
//* the users will be able to access the posts collection.
//* Each post document will include
//* {_id: post._id, author: user._id ,body: post.body}
//? - Should you embed your data or use references?
//* We shold use references, this will allow us to keep the user document leaner
