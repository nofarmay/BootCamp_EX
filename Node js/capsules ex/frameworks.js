// Express vs. Hapi— Pros and Cons
// Pros of Express
// Lesser Development Time: Express uses Javascript for both backend and frontend development. Thus, developers can generate codes faster without the need to learn a new language.
// Effective Error Handling: Express’s middleware is built to support catching errors in synchronous and asynchronous codes.
// Handling I/O Requests: Express is an excellent choice for businesses that receive thousands of requests and notifications from users daily.
// Unopinionated Framework: Express has no strict rules on dealing with specific tasks, and you can leverage middleware packages and components in any way convenient for you.
// Easy Installation: Being a minimalistic framework, Express is easy to install, set up, and has a steep learning curve. This characteristic makes it suitable for beginners with a basic understanding of backend development.
// Cons of Express
// Lack of Standardization: While Express does not require a specific structure, it can be an issue as team members increases and developers work on different functionalities of the app. Therefore, it becomes essential for teams to stick to a structure for the entire project.
// Callback Hell: Callbacks are among the most discussed issues with the Express framework as developers fail to comprehend the complicated writing style. However, the Express team has looked into the recurring problem and introduced some relief.
// Philosophy of Middleware: For developers who have never worked with Express, understanding and executing the middleware functions can be tricky.
// Pros of Hapi
// Robust Plugins: Offers rapid feature development and quicker identification of bus to fix through customized modules.
// Ease of Coding: Helps developers to write manageable, controllable, and distributable code.
// Secure Framework: Blocks error messages which may leak data or echo back unsecured loopholes.
// Caching Advantage: Improves the web application performance through continuous caching.
// Microservice Support:  Chairo plugin allows integration of Seneca functionality which is a microservice toolkit for organizing an application’s business logic.
// Integrated Authorization: Accessibility to pre-built authentication and authorization APIs.
// Cons of Hapi
// Code Configuration: Developers have to figure the code structure without community support
// Compatibility Issues: Some of the Hapi-specific modules and plugins such as catbox, joi, boom, etc. are not compatible with Express/Connect.
// Manual Testing: Creation of endpoints and testing is manual, due to lack of automation.
