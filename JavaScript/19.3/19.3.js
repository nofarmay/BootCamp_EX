// The following exercise contains the following subjects:
// ● events
// Instructions
// Many times an application needs to verify the account by
// sending a verification code by text message.
// Let's create functionality that enables the user to paste the
// verification code to the input fields.
// Features:
// 1. The user is allowed to type the values manually. After
// each value is inserted, the next input will be focused.
// 2. The user is allowed to paste the verification code.
// 3. An extra challenge will be to auto submit the form once all
// inputs all populated.
// Things to think about:
// What happens if the user pastes only 3 digits and there are
// 6 inputs to fill out.
// Here is an example.
// Things to help you:
// Google “paste event” to understand how to listen to a
// paste event.Google “clipboardData” to find out how to get the value of
// a paste event
